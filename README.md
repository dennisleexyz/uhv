The Unmanned Hybrid Vehicle (UHV) combines a drone (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle; UAV) and rover (Unmanned Ground Vehicle; UGV).

I unfortunately don't have any other files to share. If you're a team member, check/ask on Discord, and I encourage you to fork this repository to add stuff.

This was my undergraduate senior design project (under the name Flying UGV, or "Gliese-514b") with the Reconfigurable Space Computing Lab (RSCL) led by Professor Mohamed El-Hadedy Aly. We were selected by the [NASA MINDS](https://www.nasa.gov/learning-resources/minority-university-research-education-project/nasa-minds/) competition for Artemis mission research. I worked on it from Fall 2023 to Spring 2024 alongside the following team members:

- Manuel Tarula-Villareal
- Javier Eguia Chaire
- Ruben Torres Romero
- Justin Villamil

Students have rotated in and out as the project has continued since then.
